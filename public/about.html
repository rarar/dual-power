      <p><em>Dual Power</em> is an interactive installation that explores the tension between competing ideologies and power
        structures. Inspired by the political concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_power">dual power</a>, originally articulated during the Russian Revolution,
        it refers to the coexistence of two separate powers vying for legitimacy [1]. This piece extends the metaphor by
        navigating the push-pull dynamics between decentralization and centralization, the people and the state, autonomy,
        and control.</p>
      <p>Participants engage with the piece through a web interface, choosing between ideologically opposed concepts. Each
        choice serves as a microcosm of larger societal currents. These choices illuminate two bulbs in the gallery—the
        brightness of each bulb varying in real-time, reflecting the collective inclinations of the participants.
        Dual Power draws on the concept of binary oppositions in political theory, where opposing forces simultaneously
        support and contradict each other, a theme prevalent in the works of Marxist theoreticians and
        scholars–dialectical materialism[2]. This installation probes these dualities and challenges the neoliberal ideas
        of individualism by highlighting the power of collective decision-making in a digitally mediated environment[3].</p>
